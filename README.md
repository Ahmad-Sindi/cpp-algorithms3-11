# Algorithm Challenge #11 – Matrix Equality Check (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description 
-
This C++ program generates two 3×3 matrices filled with random numbers, prints them in a structured format, and checks whether both matrices are equal by comparing the sum of their elements.

Rather than comparing each cell individually, the algorithm uses a higher-level abstraction: total sum comparison.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Traversing 2D arrays using nested loops
- Understanding matrices as structured data
- Breaking logic into reusable functions
- Applying abstraction in algorithm design
- Strengthening geometric and algorithmic thinking

🧩 Example Output
-
Matrix 1:

04 06 02  
01 09 05  
07 03 08  

Matrix 2:

03 05 04  
02 08 06  
09 01 07  


Yes, Both Matrices are Equal.

💬 Notes
-
This challenge highlights an important engineering idea: sometimes comparing structures is more efficient and expressive than comparing individual elements.

Matrices should be understood geometrically before being processed logically.
